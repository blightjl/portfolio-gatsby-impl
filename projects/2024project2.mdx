Gained full experience working on a full-stack application with a team of software engineering engaging in each part of the software development life cycle via the AGILE framework. Using collaboration and iterative development, we ensured effective communication and adaptability throughout each sprint, enabling our team of four to respond dynamically to meet each sprint needs and moditifications. I prototyped visually appealing interfaces using Figma and brought them to life by implementing the designs with React, creating an interactive and user-friendly front-end. On the back-end, I developed a robust Node.js server with RESTful API integration, ensuring seamless functionality across all endpoints. To streamline the development process, I configured a CI/CD pipeline using Render, MongoDB, and GitHub, which allowed for efficient deployment and testing. This hands-on experience in end-to-end application development culminated the creation of a fully functional community web application that demonstrates both scalability and practical efficacy.
